      The San Diego based Dive Animals Scuba Club is one of the oldest dive
      clubs in San Diego California. Our club is unique in that we own our own
      dive boat, a Wellcraft, that is used by our members to dive the local
      wrecks, kelp beds, canyons, and other sites of interest. We have many
      active members diving multiple times per week, on our own boat, shore
      diving, or diving on other local charters. We usually do things in smaller
      more personalized groups for an "uncrowded" diving experience. We love to
      travel and have trips sponsored by club members and our trips are
      organized through
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/diveanimals/"
        >meetup.com</a
      >.

      We actively promote safe diving. A large number of our club members are
      Divemasters so you can always find someone to work on skills and
      techniques with you. We encourage all divers continue learning, improving
      and practicing their skills. We also have several instructors in the club
      that teach everything from Open Water to Divemaster. The club was founded
      by a dive instructor!

    <h3>Is this club for you?</h3>
    <p>
      If you need a hot shower, personal space, hot cocoa or any other basic
      level of comfort than this may not be the club for you. If you start
      shouting “hell yeah” with a smile on your face when the boat is slicing
      through bumpy swells with cold wind blowing on your face, then you’ve
      found yourself a new home.
